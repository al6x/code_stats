Power law, efficiency and decision making

[TODO about the [Power law][power_law] (also known as the Pareto principle and the 80-20 rule) and it's fundamental nature]

[TODO about my causes to write such strange tool: why it's so simple and why language-agnostic is important: find simple game project, compare my own projects with other, find big places in my sources, see spec/code ratio to evaluate helth of project]

[TODO about decition makin: right now there's tons and tons and tons of tools, projects and all stuff, it's hard to navigate, examine and score them]

[TODO efficiency: what code parts is most important]

[TODO I deliberately choose the Red color for the sources (and the Blue for specs / tests) because the less code - the better (in general, with other things been equal).]
